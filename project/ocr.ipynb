    "Optical character recognition (OCR) aims to recognize texts in imaged documents. It is probably one of the earliest computer vision techniques that have been commercialized successfully. OCR usually involves a series of image processing and recognition tasks including 1) text image binarization that converts a colour/grayscale image into a binary image with multiple foreground regions (usually characters); 2) connected component labelling that detects each binarized character region; 3) character recognition by using some classifiers such as a pre-trained neural network."

You do not need to develop OCR algorithm but use an open-source OCR software Tesseract: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract. You can google the keyword \"Tesseract\" to search for more information about how to use this software. In addition, you just need to work on either one (or both) of the two sample text images that can be downloaded from the project website in NTULearn."
